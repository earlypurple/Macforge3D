// NOTE: The implementation of the Slicer Integration is currently blocked.
// This feature is designed to work by calling an external command-line slicer
// executable (e.g., PrusaSlicer, CuraEngine, Bambu Studio).
//
// However, no slicer executable was found in the current build environment.
//
// To enable this feature, a command-line slicer must be installed and
// available in the system's PATH. Once a slicer is available, this class
// should be updated to:
// 1. Export the 3D model to a temporary STL file.
// 2. Construct the command-line arguments based on the PrintSettings.
// 3. Launch the slicer process using Swift's `Process` class.
// 4. Capture the output and handle the generated G-code file.
