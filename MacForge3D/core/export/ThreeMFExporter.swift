// NOTE: The implementation of the 3MF exporter is currently blocked.
// The 3MF format is a ZIP archive containing XML and other files.
// Creating a ZIP archive requires a library like ZIPFoundation.
// However, the current build environment does not have the Swift compiler
// and package manager available to add new dependencies.
//
// Once the environment is configured with a working Swift toolchain,
// the following steps should be taken:
// 1. Add ZIPFoundation as a dependency in Package.swift.
// 2. Run `swift package resolve` to fetch the dependency.
// 3. Implement the 3MF exporter using the ZIPFoundation library.
