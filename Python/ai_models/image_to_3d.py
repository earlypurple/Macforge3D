    Generates a 3D model from a list of image files using the photogrammetry pipeline.
    This function is the main entry point called from the Swift application.

        image_paths: A list of absolute paths to the input images.
        output_dir: The base directory where the final model and its assets will be saved.
        quality: The desired quality level ("Draft", "Default", "High").
