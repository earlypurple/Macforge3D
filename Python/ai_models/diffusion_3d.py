# This file is intended to contain the core 3D diffusion model logic.
# It would be responsible for loading the pre-trained model weights,
# defining the model architecture, and running the generation process.
#
# For example, if using the Text2Room model, this file would contain
# the code to interact with the Text2Room library, or a reimplementation
# of its core components.
#
# The `text_to_3d.py` script would then call the functions defined in this file.
