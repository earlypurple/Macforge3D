# MacForge3D Universal Setup Script
#
# This script automates the setup of the development environment for the MacForge3D application.
# It is designed to be idempotent and work on macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel) and Linux.
#
# It performs the following steps:
# 1. Detects the OS and architecture to determine the correct Homebrew path.
# 2. Installs Homebrew if it is not already present.
# 3. Installs system dependencies (Python 3.11, Git LFS) via Homebrew.
# 4. Creates a Python virtual environment.
# 5. Installs required Python packages from a requirements file.
# 6. Configures Git LFS.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
