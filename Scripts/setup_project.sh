# MacForge3D Project Setup Script
#
# This script automates the setup of the development environment for the MacForge3D application.
# It installs system dependencies using Homebrew, sets up a Python virtual environment,
# and installs the required Python packages.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - macOS
# - Xcode Command Line Tools (can be installed with `xcode-select --install`)

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
